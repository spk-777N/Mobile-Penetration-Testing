# Android Architecture

Android architecture contains a different number of components to support any Android device's needs.

software contains an open-source Linux Kernel having a collection of a number of C/C++ libraries which are exposed through application framework services.

Linux Kernel provides the main functionality of operating system functions to smartphones and Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) provide a platform for running an Android application.

# Android Architecture in Detail

Android architecture is organized into **layers**, designed to simplify app development and ensure system performance and stability. Essentially, it is divided into **four main layers**:

---

## 1. **Linux Kernel**

- The deepest layer.
- Android is built on top of a Linux kernel, responsible for:
  - Device management (drivers) like display, camera, memory, Bluetooth, etc.
  - Process management.
  - Memory management.
  - Network stack.
  - Security.

 > [!Note]
 > Android uses a modified Linux kernel optimized for mobile devices (phones and tablets).

---

## 2. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**

- A bridge between the Linux Kernel and hardware components.
- Abstracts (hides) hardware details.
- Each hardware component (like GPS or Camera) has its own HAL module.
- When Android needs to access a hardware feature, it communicates with HAL instead of interacting directly with the hardware drivers.

 **Example:** Camera app requests a photo → Android Framework communicates with HAL → HAL communicates with Camera Driver → You get the photo.

---

## 3. **Android Runtime (ART) + Native C/C++ Libraries**

### Android Runtime (ART)
- Since Android 5.0 (Lollipop), Dalvik was replaced with ART.
- ART compiles app bytecode into machine code at install time (Ahead of Time Compilation - AOT) instead of during runtime.
- Benefits:
  - Faster performance.
  - Lower battery usage.
  - Smoother app execution.

**ART Components:**
  - **Core Libraries:** Essential Java libraries (like `java.lang`, `java.util`).
  - **Garbage Collector:** Manages memory and automatic cleanup.

### Native Libraries (C/C++)
- High-performance libraries written in C/C++ for core functionalities.
- Examples:
  - **libc:** Standard system C library.
  - **SSL:** Secure communication and encryption.
  - **Surface Manager:** Renders graphics on the screen.
  - **SQLite:** Lightweight database engine.

---

## 4. **Application Framework**

- This layer is used by app developers to build Android applications.
- Provides ready-to-use **APIs** to interact with core system services.

**Key Components of the Framework:**

| Component | Function |
|:----------|:---------|
| **Activity Manager** | Manages lifecycle of apps and activities. |
| **Content Providers** | Shares data between applications. |
| **Resource Manager** | Manages resources (images, strings, layouts, etc.). |
| **Notification Manager** | Manages app notifications. |
| **View System** | Builds user interfaces (buttons, lists, etc.). |
| **Package Manager** | Manages app install/update/remove. |
| **Location Manager** | Manages access to location services. |

---

## 5. **Applications**

- The top layer users interact with.
- All apps you see (WhatsApp, Facebook, Camera, Phone...) are built on top of the Framework.
- Apps interact indirectly with lower layers via APIs.

# Components of Android Architecture

The main components of Android architecture are the following:-

- Applications
- Application Framework
- Android Runtime
- Platform Libraries
- Linux Kernel

![[android arch 2.png]]

---
### Applications

- Applications is the **top layer** of android architecture.
- This layer used to be ground to install applications on it.
- It runs within the Android run time with the help of the classes and services provided by the application framework.

![[Applications layer.png]]

---
### Application Framework

- The Application Framework is a core part of Android that gives developers the tools and services they need to build apps.
- It provides access to device features like hardware, screen display, and system resources.
- It includes several important services that make it easier to build powerful and consistent Android apps without having to create everything from scratch.

The services are as follows:
1. Activity Manager - Manages the app's activates and their life cycle Like:
	- opening
	- pausing
	- closing screens
2. Notification Manager - Allow Apps to show alerts or updates to the user.
3. Package Manager - Keeps track of all the apps installed on the device.
4. Window Manager - Handles the placement and appearance of windows on the screen.
5. Content Providers - Help apps share data with other apps like contacts or photos.
6. View System - Controls how things (like buttons or text) appear on the screen.

### Application runtime

Android Runtime environment is one of the most important part of Android.

- It contains components like core libraries and the [Dalvik virtual machine(DVM).](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mobile-computing/what-is-dvmdalvik-virtual-machine/)
- it provides the base for the application framework and powers our application with the help of the core libraries.
	- Like **[Java Virtual Machine (JVM)](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2269370/what-is-the-jvm-introducing-the-java-virtual-machine.html)**, **Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM)** is a register-based virtual machine and specially designed and optimized for android to ensure that a device can run multiple instances efficiently.
- It depends on the layer Linux kernel for threading and low-level memory management.
- The core libraries enable us to implement android applications using the standard JAVA or Kotlin programming languages.

> [!Note]
> > Now, starting from Android 5.0 and above, we use ****ART (Android Runtime)**** to compile bytecode into native code to leverage ahead-of-time compilation.

---
### Platform libraries

The Platform Libraries includes various C/C++ core libraries and Java based libraries such as Media, Graphics, Surface Manager, OpenGL etc. to provide a support for android development.

- **Media** library provides support to play and record an audio and video formats.
- **Surface manager** responsible for managing access to the display subsystem.
- **SGL** and **OpenGL** both cross-language, cross-platform application program interface (API) are used for 2D and 3D computer graphics.
- **SQLite** provides database support and **FreeType** provides font support.
- **Web-Kit** This open source web browser engine provides all the functionality to display web content and to simplify page loading.
- **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** is security technology to establish an encrypted link between a web server and a web browser.

### Linux Kernel

- Linux Kernel is heart of the android architecture.
- It manages all the available drivers such as display drivers, camera drivers, Bluetooth drivers, audio drivers, memory drivers, etc. which are required during the runtime.
- The Linux Kernel will provide an abstraction layer between the device hardware and the other components of android architecture.
- It is responsible for management of memory, power, devices etc.


The features of Linux kernel are:

- **Security:** The Linux kernel handles the security between the application and the system.
- **Memory Managment:** It efficiently handles the memory management thereby providing the freedom to develop our apps.
- **Process Management:** It manages the process well, allocates resources to processes whenever they need them.
- **Network Stack:** It effectively handles the network communication.
- **Driver Model:** It ensures that the application works properly on the device and hardware manufacturers responsible for building their drivers into the Linux build.

## Other Commonly Used Architectures in Android


### **MVC** ( Model View Controller )

[MVC or Model View Controller](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mvc-model-view-controller-architecture-pattern-in-android-with-example/) breaks the model into three main components **Model** that stores the application data , **View** UI layer that holds the component visible on the screen and **Controller** that establishes the relationship between Model and the View.

---
### **MVP** ( Model View Presenter )

To avoid complexities like maintainability, readability, scalability, and refactoring of applications we use [MVP model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mvp-model-view-presenter-architecture-pattern-in-android-with-example/). The basic working of this model relies of the points mentioned below:

- Communication between the View-Presenter and Presenter-Model happens with the help of Interface (also called Contract).
- There is One to One relationship between Presenter and View , One Presenter Class only manages One View at a time.
- Model and View doesn't have any knowledge about each other.

---
### **MVVM** ( Model View ViewModel ) :

[MVVM or Model View ViewModel](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mvvm-model-view-viewmodel-architecture-pattern-in-android/) as the name suggest like MVC model it contains three components too Model , View and ViewModel. Features of MVVM model are mentioned below:

- ViewModel does not hold any kind of reference to the View.
- Many to-1 relationships exist between View and ViewModel.
- No triggering methods to update the View.

And we can achieve this using 2 methods:

- Using DataBinding library of Google.
- Using Tools like RxJava for Data Binding.
